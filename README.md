# PyPGMc

PyPGMc will provide a PyMC2 and PyMC3 compatible implementation of message passing based inference
algorithms for probabilistic graphical models (PGM).

The goal is to scale PyMC models up, and to enable some novel applications in the
powerful PyMC MCMC Framework.

### Warning

PyPGMc is under heavy development. It is by no means complete or bug-free yet. The code might serve as
example code, but that's it so far.
