      "### Scalable Nonparametric Directed Graphical Model Inference and Learning\n\nAuthor: Kai Londenberg (Kai.Londenberg@gmail.com)",
      "\n",
      "#### Abstract\n",
      "\n",
      "This short article tries to give an overview over complementary techniques over MCMC for general inference in arbitrary directed probabilistic graphical models. The focus lies on techniques and algorithms for creating hybrid models which can be scaled to high\n",
      "dimensional problems, problems with huge data sets and distributed among multiple machines.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Motivation\n",
      "\n",
      "Two papers got me thinking: [Dauwels et al: Particle Methods as Message Passing](http://www.dauwels.com/Papers/Particle.pdf), which gives a nice overview of how to generalize Message Passing methods, by mixing  sampling based methods freely with exact or fast approximate inference algorithms. The second is [Neiswanger et al:\u0003\n",
      "Embarassingly Parallel MCMC](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.4780v1.pdf), where an algorithm is described which can be used to scale MCMC to problems with huge data sets. \n",
      "\n",
      "Both algorithms actually suffer from the same problem, namely the **Message Fusion** problem (described way down). A problem which has luckily been successfully solved before. I add to that list by proposing a new approach to efficient density estimation from MCMC models, called **Density Mapping**\n",
      "\n",
      "What I hope is, that these ideas can lead to a practical implementation of a general, flexible inference system with semantics similar to those found in common MCMC packages for Bayesian Inference, but with the capability to outperform these for problems with huge data sets or a large number of dimensions if the distribution can be factorized into smaller problems somehow.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope to be able to extend the existing Bayesian Modeling Toolkit for Python [PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc) via my side-project [PyPGMc](https://github.com/kadeng/pypgmc) to support the algorithms mentioned in this article.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this article is both an overview, and sort of a collection of ideas and roadmap items."

      "Directed Probabilistic Graphical Models (DGMs) provide a flexible and powerful framework for probabilistic reasoning. In all generality, they are a way to efficiently represent complex probability distributions in high dimensional spaces by factorizing the joint distribution into conditional distributions.\n",

By a property called D-Separation which can be determined using a few simple rules, we can safely determine whether the probability distribution of a given set of variables in the graph can be affected by changes in the probability of another set of variables **given** another set of variables which are held fixed. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "One important rule to note is, that in order to perform causal inference in such a causal network, i.e. to estimate the impact of an explicit **action** where the value of a variable is forced to have a certain value (in contrast to observing it having that value) it is neccessary to sever all ties from the parents of said variable to it (since they are no longer causally connected). Furthermore, the network\n",

Usually, Gaussian Kernels are used. Given an efficient sampling procedure from products of Gaussian Mixtures, such as [Ihler, Sudderth et al: Efficient Multiscale Sampling from Products of Gaussian Mixtures](http://ssg.mit.edu/nbp/papers/nips03.pdf), we can efficiently sample from these.

      "In [Ihler, Mc. Allister: Particle Belief Propagation](http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/AISTATS09_IhlerM.pdf) it has been proposed to sample from the particles in the messages themselves. This is similar to what happens in **Particle Filters**. While potentially a good idea, it (like Particle Filters) suffers from the *thinning* problem: If the message and the factor do not agree, the number of useable particles gets very low and the procedure produces unreliable and/or inaccurate results. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like with Particle Filters, one approach to fix this problem is to use **resampling**. That is, loosely speaking, we tell the original factor where we got the message from, that we would like to have samples of a finer resolution in certain regions. Then the original factor replies with a new (importance sampled) message list, where it provides new samples, with more (but downweighted) samples in the corresponding regions of interest. \n",
      "\n",
      "This procedure can already provide accurate distributed inference. It just has one problem: It is probably pretty slow (all this re-sampling) and requires lots of communication. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we let the numbers of particles in each list become low, it can be seen as a form of Gibbs Sampling where we exchange not just one particle (the sample), but multiple of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "This procedure, as inefficient as it might seem, might have a distinct advantage over most MCMC Algorithms: **It allows for much easier convergence diagnostics**. By measuring the convergence on a per-message level, we can probably automatically determine when the algorithm has converged to a final solution, given that we can determine this for each factor individually.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this sounds not so much of a great deal, actually it is: For MCMC you usually need a human expert who decides if the numbers of samples have been sufficient, if all relevant states have been visited etc. But even then, that person can never be sure. Much the less, if the problem gets high-dimensional. Having a clear convergence diagnostic opens the door for novel applications in large scale risk analysis."
